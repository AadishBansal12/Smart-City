# Smart City IoT Project - Comprehensive Smart City Solution with Python-based Face Detection Camera, Fire Help System, and Smart Parking 🏙️ 🚀

Welcome to the Smart City IoT Project repository, where we are building a cutting-edge solution to transform cities into smarter, safer, and more efficient spaces! 🌟

## Project Overview:

This ambitious project aims to create a fully integrated Smart City solution that addresses critical urban challenges using a combination of IoT technologies and Python-powered innovations. Our focus areas include a sophisticated Face Detection Camera 📷 to enhance security, a responsive Fire Help System 🔥 to ensure timely emergency response, and a seamless Smart Parking 🅿️ experience to ease traffic congestion.

## Key Features:

### 📹 Face Detection Camera:
Experience the power of Python and OpenCV in real-time face detection and image processing. Our smart camera system captures faces, identifies individuals, and enables secure access control.
